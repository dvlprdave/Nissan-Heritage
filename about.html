            The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was introduced in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo Motor
            Show. This model of the GT-R was also known as the "Kenmeri" Skyline, due to a popular advertisement
            featuring
            a young couple (Ken and Mary) enjoying the Hokkaido countryside.

            The Kenmeri came with an intake air duct, disc brakes for four wheels, mesh front grille, over fenders on
            wheels, and the exterior with a rear spoiler as standard equipment. Unfortunately, the second generation
            GT-R
            was unsuccessful, for a gasoline crisis hit in the early 1970s, drying out any demand for high-performance
            sports cars. A total of 197 cars were built by the end of its short production run. For the next decade,
            this
            was the last GT-R until the production of the R32 in 1989.

          The second-generation Skyline, the C110, was introduced at the 19th Tokyo Motor Show as the "Skyline 2000GT-R
          Racing Concept." The #73 was a reference to the fact that Nissan's works team planned to participate in 73
          races in the 1973 season. But soon after, the company decided to pull out of motorsports to focus on supplying
          the booming demand for small cars following the first oil crisis. The show car was restored in 2007.
