        <h3>My story</h3>
        <p>
          Skyline 2000GT-R (PGC10) was a 4-door sedan rolled out in 1969, and it became invincible at domestic touring
          car races. It remodeled to 2-door hardtop (KPGC10) in 1970. The wheelbase was shortened by 70mm and the weight
          was lightened by more than 20kg by downsizing the body.

          As well as the sedan version, 2-liter, 4-valve DOHC inline 6-cyl. “S20” engine was mounted into which all the
          technologies of engine of a prototype racing car “Nissan R380” were applied. Hardtop cars also had a fuel tank
          of 100L, full bucket seats without recliner mechanism, and spartaninterior without amenities.
          GT-R attained unprecedented 50 victories in March 1972 at domestic touring car races. It has a record of 52
          victories when Nissan works team stopped its activities in October 1972.

        <h3>My story </h3>
        <p>
          Living in NYC (with my amazing partner, David, and our two rescue cats, Jester & Jynx), I am training at HB
          Studios, Upright Citizen's Brigade and The People's Improv Theater. I train all around town with various
          coaches. And I'm currently producing my own films. My google calendar is color coded and very busy, and I
          love it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a BA in Stage and Screen Acting. In Las Vegas, I
          completed courses in improvisation and clown at Vegas Theater Hub. I also trained in Mixed Martial Arts, did
          burlesque, and stand-up.
