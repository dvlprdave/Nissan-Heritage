        <h3>My story </h3>
        <p>
          Living in NYC (with my amazing partner, David, and our two rescue cats, Jester & Jynx), I am training at HB
          Studios, Upright Citizen's Brigade and The People's Improv Theater. I train all around town with various
          coaches. And I'm currently producing my own films. My google calendar is color coded and very busy, and I
          love it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a BA in Stage and Screen Acting. In Las Vegas, I
          completed courses in improvisation and clown at Vegas Theater Hub. I also trained in Mixed Martial Arts, did
          burlesque, and stand-up.
