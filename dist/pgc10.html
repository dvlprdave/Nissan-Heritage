The know-how for prototype race car "R380" was filled in an ordinary looking sedan body*. Mounted was the 4-valve DOHC engine re-engineered from the one for R380 to suit production cars. </p> <p> It made a debut and won at “JAF GP” in May 1969, 3 months after the rollout. Since then, it kept winning until it attained 52 victories before the Nissan works team withdrew in October 1972. </p> </div> </div> </div>  <div class="racing-history"> <div class="racing-history_img"> <img class="grid-img" src="/pgc10-racing.68594bd1.jpg" alt=""> </div> <div class="racing-description"> <h3 class="racing-description_heading">Racing History </h3> <p> By the end of the series in 1972, the 2000GT-R had 50 race victories, the first 33 with the 2000GT-R PGC10, the other 17 in the short-wheelbase KPGC-10 introduced in March, 1971. </p> <p> The first win came on May 3, 1969, at the TS-b race of the 1969 JAF Grand Prix at Fuji Speedway with the four-door. From the 1969 Japan Grand Prix in October of the same year, at which the GT-R chalked up its seventh victory, a fuel injection system was adopted. Pushing maximum output to 227hp at 8,400 RPM, this gave the Skyline an even greater edge on the circuit. </p> <p> It was two years later, at the All Japan Suzuka Automobile Race (March 1971) that the hardtop GT-R was added to the formation. Attracting nationwide attention, the GT-R's string of consecutive wins stopped at 49 (with 29 consecutive wins for the works team). But the 50th victory was achieved at the very next race. </p> </div> </div> </main> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/2.1.3/TweenMax.min.js" integrity="sha256-lPE3wjN2a7ABWHbGz7+MKBJaykyzqCbU96BJWjio86U=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/app.96a73758.js"></script> </body></html>
