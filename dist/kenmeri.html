This model of the GT-R was also known as the "Kenmeri" Skyline, due to a popular advertisement featuring a young couple (Ken and Mary) enjoying the Hokkaido countryside. </p> <p> The Kenmeri came with an intake air duct, disc brakes for four wheels, mesh front grille, over fenders on wheels, and the exterior with a rear spoiler as standard equipment. Unfortunately, the second generation GT-R was unsuccessful, for a gasoline crisis hit in the early 1970s, drying out any demand for high-performance sports cars. A total of 197 cars were built by the end of its short production run. For the next decade, this was the last GT-R until the production of the R32 in 1989. </p> </div> </div> </div>  <div class="racing-history"> <div class="racing-history_img"> <img class="grid-img" src="/kenmeri-73.1dcee5e2.jpg" alt=""> </div> <div class="racing-description"> <h3 class="racing-description_heading">Racing History </h3> <p> The second-generation Skyline, the C110, was introduced at the 19th Tokyo Motor Show as the "Skyline 2000GT-R Racing Concept." The #73 was a reference to the fact that Nissan's works team planned to participate in 73 races in the 1973 season. But soon after, the company decided to pull out of motorsports to focus on supplying the booming demand for small cars following the first oil crisis. The show car was restored in 2007. </p> </div> </div> </main> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/2.1.3/TweenMax.min.js" integrity="sha256-lPE3wjN2a7ABWHbGz7+MKBJaykyzqCbU96BJWjio86U=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/app.96a73758.js"></script> </body></html>
