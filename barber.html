            Nissan combined its best technologies and produced “Skyline 2000GT-R” in February 1969 after merging with
            Prince Motors, Ltd. “GT-R” was a high performance car produced for touring car races. The know-how for
            prototype race car "R380" was filled in an ordinary looking sedan body*. Mounted was the 4-valve DOHC engine
            re-engineered from the one for R380 to suit production cars.

            It made a debut and won at “JAF GP” in May 1969, 3 months after the rollout. Since then, it kept winning
            until it attained 52 victories before the Nissan works team withdrew in October 1972.

          The second-generation Skyline, the C110, was introduced at the 19th Tokyo Motor Show as the "Skyline 2000GT-R
          Racing Concept." The #73 was a reference to the fact that Nissan's works team planned to participate in 73
          races in the 1973 season. But soon after, the company decided to pull out of motorsports to focus on supplying
          the booming demand for small cars following the first oil crisis. The show car was restored in 2007.

          I graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a BA in Stage and Screen Acting. In Las Vegas, I
          completed courses in improvisation and clown at Vegas Theater Hub. I also trained in Mixed Martial Arts, did
          burlesque, and stand-up.
